|Hey guys! I am a junior developer who likes to discover new technology.               |
|At this current moment is my focusing on learning Python and React.JS.                |
|The projects varies from web projects to data analysis. During my graduation          |
|assignment I learned about React-Native and Typescript.                               |
|In this period I have also worked with Confluence.                                    |
|                                                                                      |
|In my spare time I worked on exploring datasets with R. Due data visualization        |
|I explored my datasets and learned a lot about  the dataset itself.                   |
|Since september 2023 I am doing working experience placement at Zorgfocuz .           |
|During this period I learned about testing  and exploring  different type of testing. |
|I also got the opportunity to learn  about R in a more applied way.                   |
|Due practicing R in this company I learned how functionalities are build and          |
|how they can applied to a business.                                                   |
